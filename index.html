       I still remember the first time I saw you. It was in 5th standard, and I couldn’t stop looking at you. There was something in the way you smiled, in the way you carried yourself, that just caught my heart — and from that moment, I knew I had feelings for you. But back then, it was just a silent love, something unspoken, something that lived inside me.
        <br>
        <br>
        ❤️By the time we reached 8th standard, maybe you didn’t even know I existed beyond the brief glances we exchanged. But I still cared, in silence, thinking about you constantly. Then, in 9th standard, our paths crossed for the first time at a friend's house. I remember how we started talking — and it felt like the start of something amazing. every little thing about you fascinated me. We became close, and for the first time, I thought I had a real chance at connecting with you.<br> <br> 
        <br>
        We became friends. Not just friends — best friends. And that was the most beautiful phase of my life. 💫Those were the days when we became best friends, and every moment spent with you felt like a dream come true.💭 I used to take detours just to pass by your house — hoping to catch a glimpse of you. Sometimes I saw you. Sometimes I didn’t. And every time I did, I couldn’t even hold your gaze. My eyes would drop, my heart would race, and later, I’d regret not truly looking. <br><br>
        🫣 I’d wait by the road near my house… not because I had to be there, but because I hoped you’d walk by.During Navratri, I’d go to the temple and just wait — not for the prayers, but for you. I’d wake up early just to stand a chance of seeing you, even for a moment. Your presence, even from afar, gave my heart a strange kind of peace. 🙏💕 <br> <br>

        Our bond was hidden from the world, but it was everything to me. I still remember those silly school escapes, you waving at me secretly, and us pretending like nothing happened the next day. I miss that innocence. I miss those stolen glances. I miss us. 🥺<br><br>
        I’ve spent 17 years loving you, and in the last 9 years, we haven’t spoken — except that one time when we finally connected again… and the call dropped. I still hear that silence. And worse than silence is the ache that came after it. 😔
        <div class="button-box">
        <button onclick="showSection(4)">🙏 A Heartfelt Apology🥺</button>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div id="section4" class="section">
         🥺 It’s been so long… I’ve spent years asking myself what went wrong. How did something so beautiful turn into such a painful memory? I still carry those memories — our school days, the laughter, your smile — with a quiet kind of warmth. ☀️<br><br>
        Maybe I never expressed it properly, but I’ve loved you since childhood. Maybe that's why it was so hard for me to understand what happened when our paths suddenly drifted apart. The truth is, I was broken, I was hurt, and you left — without any closure, without a single word. 💔
       <br><br>I know I made mistakes — I regret them with all my heart. But I’m not asking for forgiveness, and I’m certainly not seeking a second chance. I’m not asking for anything in return, not even friendship, not even love. I don’t expect you to remember the good, especially now that time has created so much distance. 🌈
       <br> <br> 
       But if there's one thing I wish — it’s that you remember the good moments we shared. I just want peace. I want to know that, at least in some small way, we can let go of the pain and the silence that’s lasted so long. And it hurts to see you talk to everyone… but never me. 😢

       <br> <br> 
         Maybe things can’t go back. Maybe they shouldn’t. But if there’s even a small way to bring back a sense of peace between us — I want to try. 
         Even if you never reply, I hope you’ll read this someday and know:
         You’ve always been special to me. You still are. 💞
